## About Me:

> I am graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2022. I have focused my course work on software engineering, human computer interfacing, and data structures. I am currently a data structures teachers assistant, and I work in the natural user interfaces (NUI) lab at Colorado State University (CSU). 
>
> I earned a Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences from CSU in 2014. As a biologist I managed the bacterial fruit blotch department of a plant pathology laboratory (Eurofins Biodiagnostics) for 6 years. I returned to CSU for computer science as I witnessed the biology field progressing into computational models and machines.
>
> Prior to my college accomplishments, I served as an airborne ranger in the Army as part of the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) unit of the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. I deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

## Projects/Code:

> Here is a selection of code that I have produced. These may be full files, or portions of projects that I have worked on as part of a team.

### [Data Structures](https://github.com/A-Lyon/Public_Code/tree/main/DataStructures)
This collection of data structures were produced by me for a data structures class at CSU. I was hired to teach to students in lab sections for this class after . These files have my implementations of the data structures to accomplish the goals set by the class, many include test files.

### [NUI Lab](https://github.com/A-Lyon/Public_Code/tree/main/NUIProjects)
These partial files were produced by me on team projects for the NUI lab. This code is protected by Colorado State Universities
