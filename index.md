## About Me:

> I am graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2022. I have focused my course work on software engineering, human computer interfacing, and data structures. I am currently a data structures teachers assistant, and I work in the natural user interfaces (NUI) lab at Colorado State University (CSU). 

> I earned a Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences from CSU in 2014. As a biologist I managed the bacterial fruit blotch department of a plant pathology laboratory (Eurofins Biodiagnostics) for 6 years. I returned to CSU for computer science as I witnessed the biology field progressing into computational models and machines.

> Prior to my college accomplishments, I served as an airborne ranger in the Army as part of the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) unit of the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. I deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.
